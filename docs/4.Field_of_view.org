#+SUBTITLE: Player's field of view
#+OPTIONS: H:2 num:nil

Now that we have a map that we can move around in, its time to start
putting in systems that give some challenge to the player. We'll start
by making things difficult to see. Lack of sight is something that adds
the spice of imagined horrors that lurk in the darkness.

* Goals
Aim for this section is simple, we aim to:
- Mark areas of the map player can see from present position
- Hide any un-seen areas. Show only if explored.
~TCOD~ has many algorithms to calculate the field of view.
For our purposes I am using the simplest one it has.

* Field of view System
To start with in ~game_map[.cpp|.hpp]~ file, add a new
structure =fov_map=, which will require =game_map= to 
initialize it. =fov_map= also has two methods, =recompute= 
and =is_visible=, as well as a private member variable
=unique_ptr<TCODMap>=. Private member variable is our 
interface with ~tcod~.

</ui-code>
#+end_export

Next, we change the ~console[.cpp|.hpp]~, map draw method will
need to now take =fov_map=, so that we can check if tile is 
part of fov range. Result of this check will be passed on to 
=tile::color= method. =tile::color= method will use visibility 
value to give us a slightly different color. Making the color
about 5% brighter using =lighten_color= function in ~game_map.cpp~.

</ui-code>
#+end_export

 Method used in =lighten_color= is pretty straight 
forward, and simple. Ideally, you would convert RGB value in to
HSV/HSL and then do the necessary math to get new HSV/HSL and back to
RGB, this is beyond the scope of goals here. For the moment, we define 
our percentage offset via =lighten_color_offset= variable in file scope.

#+end_export

You'll notice we have a lot of file local variable in ~game_map.cpp~.
In a future refactor, all of these can be moved into a settings file,
which can be read during game start. For now it's expedient to leave
them as they are.

With drawing using =fov_map= done, time to move to actually calculating
the fov. =fov_map::recompute= simply calls ~tcod~'s =computeFov= method.
We pass to it, a few parameters and it will update it's own internal state
with necessary information.

</ui-code>
#+end_export

=fov_map::recompute= will only be called when the player moves to a new location.
For that part we need to change ~game_actions.cpp~, by first making it take on a 
=fov_map= as a parameter, and then calling the =recompute= method when player 
moves. We also need to call =recompute= after the player has been created in 
~main.cpp~, so that initial field of view of player is visible.

</ui-code>
#+end_export

After this we should be able to move our player character around the 
Dungeon and see a light circle around the character.

* Marking Explorered Areas
Right now the player sees the whole dungeon map, regardless of whether they've
been through whole map or not. This doesn't allow for much "Mystery". So in this
section we will only show parts of the map player has actually explored. An 
explored tile is a tile player has seen using their field of view.

We add a new =was_explored= member variable to our =tile= structure. By default
this will have value of =false=. When the tile appears in the Player's field of view
it becomes =true=.

#+begin_export html
<ui-code url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Roy-Fokker/roguelike/Part-4c/src/game_map.hpp#L19-L31" width=500 commentWidth=500>
</ui-code>
#+end_export

How does the tile get updated, you might ask? In =game_map= structure, there is now 
a =update_explored= method. It takes =position= and =fov_map=. The =update_explored= 
method, will calculate a square with player at it's center, and then call =fov_map::is_visible=
for each tile with in that square. The square's size is 2x =fov_radius=.

<ui-code url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Roy-Fokker/roguelike/Part-4c/src/game_map.cpp#L261-L290" width=500 commentWidth=500>
</ui-code>
#+end_export

We need to call =update_explored= after =fov_map::recompute= is called. Which is simple
enough, put the call to =game_map::update_explored= after each instance of call to 
=fov_map::recompute=.

</ui-code>
#+end_export

Lastly, we need to tell =console_layer::draw= to not draw anything that is not visible.

<ui-code url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Roy-Fokker/roguelike/Part-4c/src/console.cpp#L91-L106" width=500 commentWidth=500>
</ui-code>
#+end_export


This gives us a nice, hidden level, that gradually opens up as the player moves
around. Begining to look like a *Roguelike* already.
