Time to make player suffer some consequences for their actions. The creatures in
our map are too ambivalent to player's aggression. This section is pretty large
as lot of different things have to be put into place for combat to actually work.
Given the number of things we need to do, lot of the code in this section might be
very hacky, that will have to be reworked later.

First thing we are going to do is rename <code>entity_type</code> to <code>species</code>. In VSCode you can press <code>F2</code> 
on <code>entity_type</code>, type in <code>species</code> into dialog box, and accept changes in the side bar. It will
update all references across the whole project.
</p>

<p>
We need to change how our actions are handled in <code>game_actions[.cpp|.hpp]</code>. At the moment only 
player is able to have actions. In order for other creatures in the world to move, they need 
a similar agency. So we'll first split <code>do_action</code> into two functions <code>do_system_action</code> 
and <code>do_entity_actions</code>. 
</p>

<ui-code url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Roy-Fokker/roguelike/Part-6a/src/game_actions.hpp#L31-L42" width=500 commentWidth=500>
</ui-code>

<p>
<code>do_system_action</code> will take care of things not related to gameplay. Like toggling fullscreen state
and exiting the game.
</p>

<ui-code url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Roy-Fokker/roguelike/Part-6a/src/game_actions.cpp#L12-L32" width=500 commentWidth=500>
</ui-code>

<p>
<code>do_entity_action</code> will take care of things entities can do. Like move, attack, heal, taunt, etc.
For the moment our entities have no way to do these actions, that will come in future. Right now 
we are just setting things up so they can act. 
</p>

<ui-code url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Roy-Fokker/roguelike/Part-6a/src/game_actions.cpp#L34-L85" width=500 commentWidth=500>
</ui-code>

<p>
In <code>main.cpp</code>, we change how we pass along <code>handle_input</code>, and make an explict call to
<code>do_system_action</code>. Then we call <code>take_turns</code>. 
</p>

<ui-code url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Roy-Fokker/roguelike/Part-6a/src/main.cpp#L54-L63" width=500 commentWidth=500>
</ui-code>

<p>
<code>take_turns</code> will loop through all the entities, and call <code>do_entity_action</code> for each.
And for player, it will also pass along the input translated data. If the player doesn't
do anything, then the turn hasn't ended, so none of the entities will take their turn.
</p>

Now immediately after player takes some action, all the entities on the map will take
action. But they don't have any actions to take, so nothing interesting happens.
To change that we will add some "AI" logic. Not really, but it sounds nice.
</p>

<p>
In <code>take_turns</code>, for all entities we'll force the default action to be <code>move</code>. Then
in <code>do_entity_action</code>, if the entity is a player, then we call <code>player_move_attack</code>, else
we call <code>ai_move_attack</code>.
</p>

</ui-code>

<p>
<code>player_move_attack</code> is basically moving all the logic from within <code>action::move</code> switch-case that
we had before into it's own function. Nothing to else to change there.
</p>

<ui-code url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Roy-Fokker/roguelike/Part-6b/src/game_actions.cpp#L74-L104" width=500 commentWidth=500>
</ui-code>

<p>
<code>ai_move_attack</code> is very similar to <code>player_move_attack</code>, with few changes. First we call
<code>fov::recompute</code> for this entity. So that we know what it can see. If it can see the player
then it will try to move in player's direction, else it does nothing. As well as making 
sure it can't phase through walls and other entities. When it manages to reach the player, 
it will kick player in the shins. 
</p>

<ui-code url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Roy-Fokker/roguelike/Part-6b/src/game_actions.cpp#L44-L72" width=500 commentWidth=500>
</ui-code>

<p>
When moving in player's direction, we ensure it can only move one tile at a time, using
<code>unit_offset</code> function. Movement is restricted to cardinal directions. No diagonal moving.

<h2 id="org83fda0d">Refactor and reiterate</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org83fda0d">
<p>
At this point, I am going to go through the files we have and refactor some bits.
For one thing, I am going to update most of the loops to use <code>CppIterTools</code> library.
This basically means using <code>iter::enumerate</code>, <code>iter::filter</code>, etc. This
greatly simplifies the code, making it easier to understand what each section does.
Additionally, I am using the <code>|</code> (pipe) operator, to call <code>iter::</code> functions. 
</p>

<p>
For example, in <code>game_map.cpp</code>, <code>connect_rooms</code> function gets changed into
</p>
<ui-code url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Roy-Fokker/roguelike/Part-6c/src/game_map.cpp#L189-L199" width=500 commentWidth=500>
</ui-code>

<p>
This refactor has effectively touched almost every .cpp file we have so far. Since 
all except <code>input_handler</code> have some loops. The next iteration of C++ (C++20) is 
supposed to get a ranges library that is conceptually similar, C++20 version is 
based on <code>Range-V3</code> library. I suppose we could have just used <code>Range-V3</code> from 
vcpkg, to be closer to what standard will have. <code>¯\_(ツ)_/¯</code>
</p>

<p>
One advantage of using this library, and in-general the range-concept, is that it 
helps us remove <code>if &lt;condition&gt; continue/return</code> statements in most places. 
</p>

<p>
For example, in <code>console.cpp</code>, both <code>draw</code> methods can be changed to 
</p>
<ui-code url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Roy-Fokker/roguelike/Part-6c/src/console.cpp#L87-L95" width=500 commentWidth=500>

<ui-code url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Roy-Fokker/roguelike/Part-6c/src/console.cpp#L110-L118" width=500 commentWidth=500>
</ui-code>

<p>
Additionally it reduces our code depth. Code-depth being how many <b><code>{brackets}</code></b> 
in we are when look at the code structure. Shallower the depth, easier it is to 
read, for me. Bracket Colorizer extension of VSCode also helps with this.
</p>

<p>
There are still, several aspects of the code as it is currently that aren't ideal.
But as they say 'perfect is enemy of good', so I am going to leave them be, until
they become a hassle. <i><code>┬─┬ノ( º _ ºノ)</code></i>

<h2 id="org5f6b157">Art of defense and attack</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org5f6b157">
<p>
To add the ability to actually attack and reduce the health of various creatures
on in the game, we need to add some new structures. <code>vitals</code> structure in 
<code>game_entity.hpp</code> will help us keep track of a given creature's attack power,
defense strength, available hitpoints and maximum hitpoints. For the moment we 
are not using maximum hitpoints. That will become useful when we add items to 
augment entity's abilities. 
</p>

<p>
<code>game_entity</code> now has a <code>vitals</code> member, along with <code>string</code> member.
<code>string</code> will be used to save the name of entity, this can be player's name
or randomly generated creature name.
</p>

<ui-code url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Roy-Fokker/roguelike/Part-6d/src/game_entity.hpp#L41-L58" width=500 commentWidth=500>
</ui-code>

<p>
Hitpoints member of <code>vitals</code> structure is marked as being mutable, so we can modify it, 
while rest of the members are const. I think, this will be changed in future.
Not sure I like this way of marking mutable elements of a structure.
</p>

<ui-code url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Roy-Fokker/roguelike/Part-6d/src/game_entity.hpp#L31-L39" width=500 commentWidth=500>
</ui-code>

<p>
Next we have to change the <code>generate_enemies</code> function, such that it will populate
<code>vitals</code> and <code>string</code> members of <code>game_entity</code> type. The values used for populating 
<code>vitals</code> are randomly generated, so each creature is a bit unique. In future we
might choose to add some type specific modifiers, e.g. Ogres are generally stronger 
or Goblins have better defense etc. For <code>string</code> name variable, i am using the
<code>fmtlib</code>'s <code>""_format</code> literal. This is also something that will be part of next 
iteration of C++ standard.
</p>

<ui-code url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Roy-Fokker/roguelike/Part-6d/src/game_entity.cpp#L128-L140" width=500 commentWidth=500>
</ui-code>

<p>
We also have to change <code>main.cpp</code> so that player entity 
has appropriate information populated. 
</p>

<ui-code url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Roy-Fokker/roguelike/Part-6d/src/main.cpp#L41-L47" width=500 commentWidth=500>
</ui-code>

<p>
<code>game_entity::face</code> method also gets updated, so we now check if this entity 
is still alive. If they are not alive, the color is changed to red. Similarly,
<code>get_entity_at</code> function also checks if <code>game_entity</code> is alive. If it is not 
then we count it as not being present at that location.
</p>

<ui-code url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Roy-Fokker/roguelike/Part-6d/src/game_entity.cpp#L60-L71" width=500 commentWidth=500>
</ui-code>

<p>
<code>game_actions.cpp</code> there is now a new function <code>do_attack</code>, which takes in
two <code>game_entity</code> objects, an attacker and defender. Player and AI move_attack
function now simply call this one do_attack function. We also ensure that 
AI doesn't do any calculations for any entities that are dead.
</p>

<p>
<code>do_attack</code> function, reduces the hitpoints of the defender entity, by 
some value based on attacker's power and defender's defense value. Then 
prints appropriate message.
</p>

<ui-code url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Roy-Fokker/roguelike/Part-6d/src/game_actions.cpp#L44-L69" width=500 commentWidth=500>
</ui-code>

<p>
<code>do_attack</code> gets called by both <code>player_move_attack</code>
</p>
<ui-code url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Roy-Fokker/roguelike/Part-6d/src/game_actions.cpp#L136-L140" width=500 commentWidth=500>
</ui-code>
<p>
and <code>ai_move_attack</code>.
</p>
<ui-code url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Roy-Fokker/roguelike/Part-6d/src/game_actions.cpp#L98-L102" width=500 commentWidth=500>
</ui-code>

<p>
Now running the game, we can see that creatures lose health when being
attacked. The rules governing how damage is taken is consistent, with only
variable being the starting vitality of creature in question. You can play
around with numbers and see how game becomes easier or harder for the player.
