#+SUBTITLE: Player's field of view
#+OPTIONS: H:2

Now that we have a map that we can move around in, its time to start
putting in systems that give some challenge to the player. We'll start
by making things difficult to see. Lack of sight is something that adds
the spice of imagined horrors that lurk in the darkness.

* Goals
Aim for this section is simple, we aim to:
- Make the player not see good!!!
~TCOD~ has many algorithms to calculate the field of view.
For our purposes I am using the simplest one it has.

:TODO: stuff happens -- TBD
