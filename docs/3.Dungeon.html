The player can move around, and there are few rooms. But at this time nothing connects
the rooms, so player cannot go from one room to another. Additionally, room generation
is very static, it's the same everytime; and that's boring.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org48901ab" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org48901ab">Goals</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org48901ab">
<p>
So let's fix both these issues.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Simple rooms generator</li>
<li>Connect all the generated rooms</li>
</ul>
<p>
For this round, neither of these two goals will use a complex algorithm.
Idea is to get it to be random enough that it feels different. But is simple to 
implement and understand.

<p>
As is always the case, one can never be satisfied with how things are. So things must 
change. For this cycle, we want to do two things:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Change <code>game_map</code> structure so that it has list of rooms.</li>
<li>Ensure that player always starts in one of these rooms.</li>
</ul>
<p>
All the changes in this refactor are in service of these two items. 
I've added <code>room</code> structure, and <code>game_map</code> structure has an array of these <code>rooms</code>.
Additionally, I am changing the <code>tile</code> structure, such that it now has two data
members and two function members; and everything that use <code>tile</code> was updated to use 
new members. And lastly, renamed <code>map_size</code> to <code>dimension</code>, since <code>game_map</code> has 
dimension, and <code>room</code> has dimension. They can use the same type.
The way we ensure that player always starts in one of the rooms, we get 1st room
from <code>game_map</code> and put the player in centre of that room.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgc12b569" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgc12b569">Simple rooms generator</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc12b569">
<p>
We start by adding two member functions to <code>room</code>, <code>center</code> and <code>intersects</code>, first 
just returns centre of the room, while second tells you if this room intersects 
another room. 
</p>

<p>
Most of the changes for this section, will be modifying <code>game_map.cpp</code> file. We will 
also be using <code>vcpkg</code> to get a library to help with iterating over arrays. The library
in question is called <code>CppIterTools</code>, there are many librarys for C++ that do similar 
things as this library. e.g. <code>NanoRanges</code>, <code>Easy Iterator</code>, <code>Range-V3</code>, etc. You could 
achieve the same with any of them. You can download the library using following command.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell">vcpkg install cppitertools
</pre>
</div>
<p>
And because it's a header only library, we don't have to change anything in CMakeLists to 
make use of it. <code>vcpkg</code> automagic!!!.
</p>

<p>
We start by changing <code>generate_map</code> function, first we change how tiles array is populated.
Previously, we populated the <code>tiles</code> member with default wall type of <code>ground</code>, now we make 
it a <code>wall</code>. Using the <code>CppIterTools</code> the code is much more readable, and simpler to write.
</p>

<p>
The idea is each room we make will change the tile type from being <code>wall</code> to <code>ground</code>. 
Continuing on, our rooms array will be generated by <code>make_rooms</code> function. This function
will take in size of our map, as well as tiles on the map.
</p>

<p>
Now I could have written <code>make_rooms</code> function in many different ways. However, I've choosen
to compartmentalize each sub-process used to make rooms into their own <code>lambda</code> function.
So there are two lambda functions within <code>make_rooms</code> function. <code>change_tiles</code> which will
given a <code>room</code> structure change the <code>tiles</code> array to ground type for that part of the map 
array. <code>make_random_room</code> simply generates a randomly sized room, keep it constrained 
with in map size and room size. Randomization is generated using C++'s <code>&lt;random&gt;</code> header.
</p>

<p>
Then taking <code>make_random_room</code> lambda functions, make a random room, check if it intersects with any
other room already in the array, if it intersects we reject that random room and generate a new one.
If the room does not intersect then we add it to the list of rooms. The intersection test against
rooms array is done using C++'s <code>find_if</code> algorithm function.
</p>

<p>
After I have list of rooms, I loop through them and call <code>change_tiles</code> to make sure room is visually
and structurally represented. And we return to our <code>generate_map</code> function.
</p>

<p>
There are also few file local variables defined to constrain the size of rooms, and how many rooms we 
want per map generation.
</p>

<p>
And that's our "Simple Rooms Generator". There are many better algorithms out there. This one is very 
much dependent on just simple random number generator. No smarts required/applied.

<h2 id="org49d7809">Connecting all the rooms</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org49d7809">
<p>
Having a billion rooms you can't get to is not fun. A game must be fun. So, next up, <code>connect_rooms</code>
function. Similar to <code>make_rooms</code>, we have few lambda functions that do the various sub tasks involved
in connecting two rooms.
</p>

<p>
Similar to <code>make_rooms</code>'s <code>change_tiles</code> lambda, here we have <code>make_hallway</code> lambda, which changes <code>1</code> tile
to <code>tunnel</code> type, if tile is not already <code>ground</code>. I know naming is inconsistent. Might fix that in future.
For rest of the this article assume hallway and tunnel are used interchangably.
</p>

<p>
Next we have two lambda that do same effective job, one makes vertical tunnels/hallways other makes horizontal
tunnels/hallways. All the connections between rooms will have a 90 degree turn, if required.
</p>

<p>
Lastly we loop through all the rooms, and pass to previously mentioned lambdas, there is a random number generator 
here, to determine which room is primary. Notice we change the flip value between horizontal and vertical hallway 
calls. This is to ensure, that we don't start both tunnels at primary room.
</p>

<p>
Having done all this, we now have a series of rooms, we can walk around in. We can control how many rooms there 
are on a map, how big or small they can be. Amount of code is not all that much. Just organizing it makes a lot 
of difference.
