Slowly we get closer to something resembling a game. Player
can move around, they don't see the whole map. There are random
rooms, tunnels/hallways. But there is nothing else to do. This 
section solve that last problem, by adding entities to direct
player's RAGEEEEEEEEEEE! 
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgd623640" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgd623640">Goals</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgd623640">
<p>
So breaking down the tasks for this section, we get
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Add randomized number of enemies in each room.</li>
<li>Draw them only if Player can see them.</li>
<li>Collision detection with enemies.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org1ec71d4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org1ec71d4">Demons of the world</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org1ec71d4">
<p>
To generate all the enemies, we will modify the <code>game_entity</code> structure.
Gone are <code>char</code> and <code>TCODColor</code> member variables, and in comes <code>entity_type</code>
member variable. <code>entity_type</code> is an enum class with 3 values for the moment.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>player</li>
<li>ogre</li>
<li>goblin</li>
</ul>
<p>
Logically speaking, there is nothing really special about the player. So I'll
be treating them same as any other character in the game. 
</p>

<p>
Additionally, there is now <code>face</code> method within <code>game_entity</code> structure. This method 
will return a <code>std::pair</code> of <code>char</code> and <code>TCODColor</code> from a file local <code>std::array</code> 
object. Values in this array are placed in same order as <code>entity_type</code> values, so 
it can be indexed into. We have to also change <code>console_layer::draw</code> method for entities 
to use <code>face</code> method to get info about how to draw a <code>game_entity</code>, done via structured 
binding.
</p>

<p>
Another new function being added is <code>generate_enemies</code>, which will return a list of 
<code>game_entity</code> objects with <code>type</code> member begin either <code>ogre</code> or <code>goblin</code>. It will take
in list of all the rooms in the map, and place these <code>game_entity</code> objects within those
rooms. We are again use C++17 random header for random number generation. <code>place_enemies_in_room</code>
lambda will place between <code>0</code> and <code>max_enemies_per_room</code> enemies in the room provided.
The distribution between <code>goblins</code> and <code>ogres</code> is 80/20, meaning 80% of the time it's goblins
rest is ogres.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, for this section, we modify the <code>main</code> function. Removed the player specific <code>game_entity</code>
object, and added a call to <code>generate_enemies</code>. After getting a list of enemies, we add a player 
specific <code>game_entity</code> object to the list of all entities, along with creating a reference to 
the same player object in the all entities list. To draw all of them, there is simple for loop
that just goes over all entities and calls <code>console_layer::draw</code>.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org5bec50c" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org5bec50c">In the darkness hides</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org5bec50c">
<p>
We have all the entities in the world rendering, but it sort of gives away their position
to the player, removing all the suspense. 
</p>

<p>
So for this section, we will change how <code>console_layer::draw</code> works with entities, by removing
draw method for a singular entity, and adding draw method to take whole entities list at once. 
In order to hide any entity not in player's view, we will also pass in the <code>fov_map</code>.
</p>

<p>
Then is a matter of simply looping through the entities list, and check if they are in player's 
field of view. If they are, then draw them, else continue to next. Also removed is the for loop
in <code>main</code> function that did the looping, instead it's just a single line call to our new <code>draw</code> 
method.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org97d2b15" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org97d2b15">Don't tread on my personal space</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org97d2b15">
<p>
We now have enemies appearing only if they are in player's field of view, but they are bit
ethreal. Player can simple walk over them, surely demons would object to such attitude.
</p>

<p>
In order to stop the player from doing this we'll change the <code>do_action</code> function, it will
now also take in list of all the entities. In the <code>move</code> switch case block, we now attempt 
to find out if the position the player will move into is already occupied or not. If it's not
occupied, then player can continue to that point. However, if it is occupied then, we will 
print a flavour text message to the console. 
</p>

<p>
To support checking if point on the map is occupied, <code>get_entity_at</code> function has been added
to <code>game_entity[.cpp|.hpp]</code>. Also to support printing of flavour text <code>to_string</code> function also
now exists in the same file.
</p>

<p>
Now when player attempts to walk over ogres and goblins, they won't be able to. And they'll
also annoy the creature they bumped into.
